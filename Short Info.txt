Updated for the most recent TF2 patch.

Please let me know if there are any issues, in particular with the parachute icon and the taunt interface.
Updates to the cross and cmyk versions will hopefully follow pretty soon.
There are various bugs in this version. I will try to keep up with GitHub issue tracker and fix as much as I can.

FontForge broke some of the font-hinting when changing the metrics to fit the HUD again, so there are some issues with the text display.
